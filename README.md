# Python-SQL-gameDatabase
This is a personal project of mine that implements an SQL database that holds data for a hypothetical game.
The database is accesable via a python based CLI that allows the user to interract with the database.

Current Features:
Database creates 3 tables players, items, and item_inst.
Only the players table can be interracted with at the moment.

TODO:
Write Unit Tests for overall system
Complete interractions with items and item_inst
Fix the known Bugs

Known Bugs:
  1. SQL server does not save data from previous runnings of the server.
