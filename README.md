# Python-SQL-gameDatabase
This is a personal project of mine that implements an SQL database that holds data for a hypothetical game.
The database is accesable via a python based CLI that allows the user to interract with the database.

Current Features:
Database creates 3 tables players, items, and item_inst.
Only the players table can be interracted with at the moment.

TODO:
Add Create, delete, use, display, and move functions to items_inst_table
Add displayPlayersItems function to items_inst_table
Add parameter requirements for modifying and adding players and items (e.g. only positive levels)
Write Unit Tests for overall system

Feature Ideas:
1. save and exit instead of always comitting
2. New statistics options either those from python or SQL
3. GUI
4. A seperate interraction mode where players can interract with their enviornment!  


Known Bugs: 
  NONE at the moment
  
 DONE:
 Add response lines to all interractions so users can see what they just did
